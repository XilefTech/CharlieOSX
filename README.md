# CharlieOSX
*By XilefTech from the "Lego Spirits"*

CharlieOSX is the best choice as a program for your specific robot.
Just fill in your robot Parameters in the config.py file and everything else like driving and robot handling is set up automatically.


### How to use CharlieOSX with your robot:
#### Prerequisites
- Pybricks OS
- some kind of python (idk what exactly)
- (Pybricks extension for VS-Code)

1. Download and open this project in VS code
2. Open the config.py file and fill in everything that is needed about your robot
3. You can now add as many execute() functions as you like to the end of the main.py file with an array with the number codes. *Note: you can add multiple commands directly after each other in the array and the robot will drive them all*
4. Just download and the robot will execute your instructions

#### Features
